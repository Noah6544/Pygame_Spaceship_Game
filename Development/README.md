# Pygame Spaceship Game, DEVELOPMENT
Little spaceship game I'm working on in freetime to learn pygame more.

# Version 0.6 in development. 
- Most recent update (5/18/22)

## Completed:
- Fixed the end screen bug.

## Currently being worked on:
- Developing and end screen system to quit the game or to replay again
- Finding best font to fit the game
- Lowering speed in end screen so a player doesn't accidentally chose one choice or the other.
- 2 boxes red and blue, for no and yes, will need text in both so that you can choose if you want to play again.
- Pixel perfect text aligning in the main game and in the win screen



## Back-Burner Progress:
- Updating player image sprites to be more visually pleasing.
- Making the timer system more visually pleasing, scale the timer system for the smaller scale game
- Fixing the smaller scale game, the timer is scaled wrong, and the place holder "it" images aren't working.
- IDEA: Implement a game selection for best 2/3 or first to 3, editing player speeds before the game starts, etc.
