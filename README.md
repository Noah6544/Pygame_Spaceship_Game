# Versions:
#### Class integration (2/18/22)
 - Began creating classes for player1, fleshed out the first class. 
## Version 0.1 (2/23/22)
 - Been putting off updating this for some time because I was having trouble with the pygame.rect object and the pygame.Rect.colliderect functions. I thought that it was above what I was able to do but it was extremely easy and pretty fast. Lesson learned: Always try  before giving up, and before you give up, make sure you know why. Don't just "ah I can't do this" instead, make sure its something more like, "I can't get this done because I don't know how to work with parent and child inheritance classes and I don't have time right now. Don't give up when you're frustrated, chances are, you're about to hit gold.
 -Integrated the new inheritance class was a ton easier than i thought it was going to be. super function is a life-saver, just the other day i was looking at it thinking I wasn't going to use it until im wayy more experiences, but wow. 
 - Integrated new collisions with rectangle objects and have them reset positions on collisions, will continue to buildup the bare bones of the program then polish this minigame. I will then make a UI menu to select minigames
## Version 0.2 (2/25/22)
### Completed: 
 - Wrapped up integration of old outstanding functions into classes for the arrow key and wasd players. 
 - Completely deleted the old "enemy" variable from when I didn't fully have a complete vision.
Also doing some laptop coding on the drive back for about 2 or so hours.
 - Randomly selects who is 'it" at the start of the game
 - a TEMPORARY visual replacement for who is it with a yellow border (all I could manage with ms paint due to not having any photo editing software currently avaliable on this laptop, will make a more final image on main pc

 ### ToDo:
  - Edit the image for player who's "it"  instead of having a yellow box.
  - Create a text that will attatch to the player who's it and will say "IT!" or something similar
  - Create a scoreboard for everytime a player is tagged, and possibly a timer counting down to see who can get the most tags
  - An ending UI prompting players to play again/go to another minigame.
