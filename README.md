# Pygame_Spaceship_Game
Little spaceship game I'm working on in freetime to learn pygame more.
## Reason
- The reason to make the game is to learn pygame more and to have a game to show to my friends to impress them, obviously. 
- I also need something to occupy me in my free period so this is a great little project.
## Game Objective:
- Create a UI with a minigame selection area to go into different minigames (More valuable learning experience to make a few smaller games with the biggest game elements staying the same through projects)
- I think a tag game would be interesting, the movement for some reason feels pretty smooth, or maybe I'm just appreciating it being bug free.
- Another idea is that both players have to shoot precise targets that are moving at one end of the screen. First to 3 rounds win
- Another Another idea is to make this a minigame of sorts, which would be difficult to implement, but rewarding to accomplish.
## Completed:
- General movement
- Converted all players to class variables as opposed to...not? Everything is much more scalable, as there's now a possibility to add ability to change player ship skin to another image.
## WIP (work in progress):
- Create a UI to select different minigames (i.e: Tag(current focus), a shooter, etc)
- Polish tag game to be more...fun
