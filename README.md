# Pygame Spaceship Game, DEVELOPMENT
Little spaceship game I'm working on in freetime to learn pygame more.

# Version 0.5 in development.
- Working on splitting game into different files to make management easier.
- Making the timer system more visually pleasing, scale the timer system for the smaller scale game
- Fixing the smaller scale game, the timer is scaled wrong, and the place holder "it" images aren't working.
- Revamping UI.
