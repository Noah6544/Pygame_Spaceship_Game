# Pygame_Spaceship_Game
Little spaceship game I'm working on in freetime to learn pygame more.
## Reason
- The reason to make the game is to learn pygame more and to have a game to show to my friends to impress them, obviously. 
- I also need something to occupy me in my free period so this is a great little project.
## Game Objective:
- This is currently a work in progress, as I'm working on changing my project to be object oriented with classes. At the start of the project I was following a tutorial which wasn't using classes so I'm having to convert everything.
- I think a tag game would be interesting, the movement for some reason feels pretty smooth, or maybe I'm just appreciating it being bug free.
- Another idea is that both players have to shoot precise targets that are moving at one end of the screen. First to 3 rounds win
- Another Another idea is to make this a minigame of sorts, which would be difficult to implement, but rewarding to accomplish.
## Completed:
- I was having an issue where 2 players couldn't functionally move on the screen at the same time because when any of  the keys were released, it would stop everyones movement, pretty much making it unplayable.
- General movement
- Converted player1 to class based system, increasing ease of scaleability.
## WIP (work in progress):
- Make it a game.
