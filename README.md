# Pygame Spaceship Game, DEVELOPMENT
Little spaceship game I'm working on in freetime to learn pygame more.

# Version 0.6 in development. 
- Most recent update (8/21/22)

## Completed:
### I pretty much finished the game. Version 0.6 only has 1 major bug.
- added and fixed the yes/no features at the end of the game to play again
- added a feature (suprised it was quick to add) that shows a fun little message every time players collide
- Added and fixed a function which centers text when added (when applicable)

#ToDo: fix the only bug left which is that a trail is left on the last charcter.

## Back-Burner Progress:
- Updating player image sprites to be more visually pleasing.
- Fixing the smaller scale game, the timer is scaled wrong, and the place holder "it" images aren't working.

## Previous tasks completed:- Developing and end screen system to quit the game or to replay again
- Finding best font to fit the game
- Lowering speed in end screen so a player doesn't accidentally chose one choice or the other.
- 2 boxes red and blue, for no and yes, will need text in both so that you can choose if you want to play again.
- Pixel perfect text aligning in the main game and in the win screen
